## Attitude

- Your mark regarding attitude will be calculated according to:
   - The delivery of EVERY exercise
   - Your participation in class and the forums. This participation will have to be **meaningful** and, of course, in **English**.
      - Meaningfulness will be associated to the quality of your participations, not the quantity
- Any **copy attempt** in any exam/exercise will make you fail **the WHOLE trimester**. If you let anyone copy your work, you will also fail.
- Using code generation AI tools is forbidden. Using them during activities or tests will make you fail the trimester.
