Geany is an easy text editor with some basic features of an IDE. It can be downloaded for free from its [official website](https://www.geany.org), where we will find versions for Linux, Windows and Mac.

> **NOTE**: regarding **Linux** (Ubuntu) users, it is better to install Geany from *Synaptic* package manager, which can be run from *System tools* section. Then, you can look for "geany" and install the corresponding package.

### 1. Work environment

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-01-Geany1_en.png" alt="Geany work environment" />
</div>

Geany's work environment has the following sections:
1. Menu.
2. Toolbar (optional)
3. Side bar with tabs:
    1. Documents → List of documents.
    2. Symbols → List of code symbols.
4. Edit window.
5. Message window, with the following tabs:
    1. Status → A list of status messages.
    2. Compiler → Compiler messages.
    3. Messages → General messages. 
    4. Scribble → To make annotations.
6. Status bar, where we can see, among other things, the row and column we are editing, the file type, encoding...

### 2. Main features

#### 2.1. Syntax highlighting

This is a very useful feature when we are typing code, since we can easily detect some basic typographic errors as we type the code. Besides, it helps us understand the whole code with a simple glance.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-02-Coloreado.png" alt="Geany syntax highlighting" />
</div>

As we can see in previous image, reserved words are written in a different color (blue). If we type a reserved word and it is not written in blue, then we may have not written it properly, so we can check it immediately, without waiting for the compilation error.

#### 2.2. Code folding

Geany provides a basic code folding. This folding lets us show or hide some parts of the code, so that we can focus only in the parts that we are currently editing. This feature can be enabled or disabled from *Edit/Preferences* menu.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-03-Folding1.png" alt="Geany code folding" />
</div>

From this menu, we can also enable the possibility of folding and unfolding every nested foldings that are inside the code block that we are trying to fold/unfold. By default this option is disabled, so we have to fold/unfold every code block independently.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-04-Folding2.png" alt="Geany code folding" />
</div>

#### 2.3. Word and symbol auto completion

This option can be configured in *Edit/Preferences* menu, under *Editor* option, in *Completions* tab.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-05-Completados.png" alt="Geany code auto completion" />
</div>

With this feature enabled, we will see a list of suitable options whenever we type the beginning of a reserved word, so we will be able to complete it just typing Enter. By default it is enabled to show the list when we type the first 4 letters of the reserved word. Besides, we can also configure the automatic completion of parentheses, curly braces, square brackets and so on. This is really useful if we usually forget to close these symbols.

#### 2.4. Some additional useful features

Apart from the main useful features shown before, we can also highlight the following features from Geany:

* **Auto closing XML/HTML tags**: in the *Edit/Preferences* menu, under *Editor* option, we can also activate the auto closing of XML/HTML tags when we type the corresponding opening tag.
* **Multi language support**: Geany lets us choose among many different programming languages, such as C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, C# and others, with their own auto completion and syntax highlighting. We can select the language from *Document > Set file type* menu, choosing the appropriate programming language.
* **Geany startup**: when we run Geany, every open document from our previous session will be open again. This feature can be configured in *Edit/Preferences* menu, under *General* option, in *Startup* tab.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-12-Inicio.png" alt="Geany startup configuration" />
</div>

* **Clone documents**: in the *Document* menu there is a *Clone* option that lets us not only copy the text of current document, but also its properties, such as cursor position. It can be really helpful for creating many source files with a similar structure.

#### 2.5. Keybindings

There are many shortcuts or key bindings available in Geany, as we can also see in many other applications. In the following tables we can see some of the most common ones. These shortcuts can also be configured from *Edit-Preferences* menu, in the *Combinations* tab.

Besides these shortcuts, you can check all the possible ones [here](https://www.geany.org/manual/current/index.html#keybindings)

### 3. Creating, compiling and testing our code

Once we have finished typing our source code, we can test it from Geany, by using the *Build* menu.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-06-MenuCompilar.png" alt="Geany Build menu" />
</div>

If we go to *Build/Set Build Commands* option, we can see the compiler that will be run when we try to compile the program. 

Whenever we create a new document with Geany, it is important to save it with an appropriate name and extension before typing any code in it. This way, Geany will fill the corresponding compilation and execution commands automatically with the appropriate tools. Besides, only after detecting the type of source code that we are typing, code highlighting and auto completion will be activated.

There are auto-detected compilers for C# and HTML (this last one is an interpreted language, so it has no compiler):

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-07-ComandosConst.png" alt="Build commands for C#" />
</div>

There are also auto-detected copilers for C and Java:

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-08-ComandosConstJ.png" alt="Build commands for Java" />
</div>

If we want to use Windows' C# compiler instead of *mono*, we must manually fill the corresponding fields as we can see in the following image. Previously, we must locate the folder in which this compiler called **csc** exists, and copy the full path in the *Compile* field.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-09-ComandosConst.png" alt="Build commands for C# with Windows compiler" />
</div>

We can also configure the editor to underline with red color every compilation error. This option is available under *Edit/Preferences* menu, inside *Editor* option, in *Features* tab.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-10-Compilar.png" alt="Compilation errors" />
</div>

As we can see in the image above, we can check every compilation error in the compiler messages window at the bottom of the window.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema02-11-CompilarJava.png" alt="Java compilation example" />
</div>

In previous image we can see how to use different source code types, and each one has its own assigned compiler, so we can compile each document with its associated compiler.

> **Exercise 1:**
>
> Open Geany and create a new source file called `Test.java` with the following source code:

```java
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
```

> See how Geany highlights the code. Also, check or enable the word auto completion and try it by adding a new line with the code to write "World" (just copy the line that says "Hello" and replace it with "World"). 

> **Exercise 2:**
> 
> Compile the source file of previous exercise. If there has been no errors, run it.

> **Exercise 3:**
> 
> Create a file called `test.c` with Geany. Remember: after choosing *File-New*, then choose *File-Save As* and save it with .c extension, so that code will be highlighted as we type it. Then, write the following code. Check the code auto completion, compile the program (using the *Build* option in case of C or C++) and run it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello");
    return 0;
}
```

> **Exercise 4:** 
> 
> Try some of previous Geany keybindings with any of the source files created so far.
