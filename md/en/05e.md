Version Control Systems (VCS) usually offer some form of branching support. Branching allows multiple lines of development to be worked on in parallel. This means we can keep the main branch stable while developing new and untested features in separate branches.

Traditionally, branching has been an expensive operation in many VCSs, but Git's implementation of branches is extremely lightweight, making branch operations almost instantaneous. This makes switching between branches quick and simple.

This document explains the commands used to create new local branches and to merge two branches.

### 1. Branches

As we've previously discussed, every commit made in Git creates a snapshot.

A branch in Git is essentially a **lightweight, movable pointer to one of these commits**. The default branch name in Git used to be **master**, but now **main** is often the default in new repositories. This shift is most visible on platforms like GitHub, where **main** has replaced **master** as the default branch for new projects.

For the rest of this document, *master* will be used as the name of the default branch for consistency.

#### 1.1 Creating a Branch

The following command creates a new branch called *testing* that points to the current commit. This command does not switch to the new *testing* branch:

```sh
git branch testing
```

Alternatively, you can create and switch to a new branch in a single command:

```sh
git checkout -b testing
```
Or, using the more modern command:

```sh
git switch -c testing
```

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_B1_05e_Git_branches_0.png" alt="New testing branch" width="80%"/>
</div>

#### 1.2 Checking the Current Branch

To find out which branch you’re on, you can use either:

```sh
git branch
```
or
```sh
git status
```

Both commands will tell you the current branch and show additional useful information about your working directory. 

Although the `git log --oneline --decorate` command can also reveal the branch via the HEAD pointer, the above commands are simpler for this purpose.

#### 1.3 Switching Branches

To switch to an existing branch, use the `git checkout` command, or the newer `git switch`:

```sh
git checkout testing
```
or
```sh
git switch testing
```

After running the command, the HEAD pointer moves to the *testing* branch.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_B1_05e_Git_branches_2.png" alt="HEAD pointer now points to testing branch" width="80%"/>
</div>

Now that you’re working on the *testing* branch, any new commits will move the *testing* branch pointer and HEAD to the new commit. So, **make some changes to the files and commit them**:

```sh
git commit -a -m "new commit"
```

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_B1_05e_Git_branches_3.png" alt="Testing branch pointer points to the new commit" width="80%"/>
</div>

Notice that the *testing* branch has moved forward, but the *master* branch still points to the previous commit. Let’s switch back to the *master* branch:

```sh
git checkout master
```
or
```sh
git switch master
```

As a result, HEAD points back to *master*, and all files in your working directory revert to the state they were in before the *testing* branch was created. **Switching branches changes the files in your working directory.**

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_B1_05e_Git_branches_4.png" alt="Git HEAD pointer back to master commit" width="80%"/>
</div>

You can now **make changes and commit** again on the *master* branch. Your Git repository will have two divergent branches.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_B1_05e_Git_branches_5.png" alt="Git HEAD pointer" width="80%"/>
</div>

You can switch between these branches as needed and develop changes independently. To easily see the divergent branches, use the following command:

```sh
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
```

You will get an output similar to this:

```sh
* c2b9e (HEAD, master) Make other changes
| * 87ab2 (testing) Make a change
|/
* f30ab Add feature #32 - ability to add new formats to the central interface
* 34ac2 Fix bug #1328 - stack overflow under certain conditions
* 98ca9 Initial commit of my project
```

#### 1.4 Merging Branches

Once development on a specific branch is complete, you can merge the changes into another branch. For example, to merge the *testing* branch into the *master* branch, first `checkout` the *master* branch, and then use the `git merge` command:

```sh
git checkout master
git merge testing
```
or, using the modern command:

```sh
git switch master
git merge testing
```

If the branches have diverged, Git will create a new merge commit with the result. However, if the branches can be fast-forwarded, no new commit will be created, and the *master* branch will simply move forward.

**Deleting Merged Branches**

If the merge was successful, you may want to delete the *testing* branch, as its changes are now part of the *master* branch. Use this command to delete the branch:

```sh
git branch -d testing
```

This command does not delete the previous commits, it only deletes the branch pointer. If the branch hasn't been merged, and you still want to delete it, you can force the deletion with:

```sh
git branch -D testing
```

**Basic Merge Conflicts**

Sometimes conflicts arise during merges, especially if the same part of a file has been modified in both branches. You may see something like this:

```sh
$ git merge testing
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

In this case, Git could not merge the branches automatically, so user intervention is required. To see which files have conflicts, run `git status`. The output will be similar to this:

```sh
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
(fix conflicts and run "git commit")
Unmerged paths:
(use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
both modified: index.html
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Files with merge conflicts are listed as unmerged. Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the conflicted files, which you can open and resolve manually. The file will contain a section like this:

```html
<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> testing:index.html
```

This shows the version in *HEAD* (your *master* branch) above the `=======` line and the version from the *testing* branch below. To resolve the conflict, you can either choose one version or merge the changes. For example, you might resolve the conflict like this:

```html
<div id="footer">
please contact us at email.support@github.com
</div>
```

Once you've resolved all conflicts, **run `git add` on each file to mark it as resolved**, and then commit the merged files. If you need to cancel the merge entirely, you can use:

```sh
git merge --abort
```

#### 1.5 Remote Branches

Local branches are not automatically shared with remote repositories. If you're working privately, you don’t need to share them. However, if you want to collaborate with others on a specific branch, you’ll need to push it to the remote repository:

```sh
git push --set-upstream <remote> <branch>
```

If you've used the `clone` command, the default remote is named **origin**.

Modern Git versions often prompt you to set the upstream branch automatically when pushing a branch for the first time. Setting an upstream branch associates your local branch with a branch on a remote repository, allowing you to use `git push` and `git pull` without having to specify the remote every time.

> **Exercise 1:**
> Create a local Git repository. Commit a small text file. Create a branch called `hotfix` to apply some changes, make some commits on the new branch. Finally, merge the branch into the master branch.
>
> Test what happens when you modify the same part of a file in different branches and attempt to merge them. Try to resolve the conflict.
