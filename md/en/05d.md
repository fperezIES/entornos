</div>

In this section, we will learn how to use Git through some of the most popular IDEs and version control tools, so we don't need to rely on the command line. However, keep in mind that to use all these applications, Git MUST already be installed on your system, following the steps provided in previous sections.

### 1. Git GUIs: GitKraken

First, let's talk about graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow us to manage Git commands. **GitKraken** is a free Git tool that works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. There is also a commercial version available if you need to work with private repositories or require some advanced features.

You can download it from its [official website](https://www.gitkraken.com/). After installation, start the application. The first time you launch it, it will ask you to register, either with your GitHub account (if you already have one) or by creating a GitKraken account. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create a GitKraken account, but signing up with GitHub allows you to easily clone your GitHub repositories later. If you choose this option, GitKraken will guide you through connecting to GitHub from its main website.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-22-GitKraken_Register.png" alt="GitKraken signup" width="50%"/>
</div>

After signing up, you will see the welcome screen:

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-23-GitKraken_Welcome.png" alt="GitKraken welcome screen" width="80%"/>
</div>

- From the left option (*Open a project*), you can connect to a remote repository (from GitHub or Bitbucket, for example) and download it.
- From the middle option (*Start a local project*), you can start a new local project and create files within it. You can then commit and upload the changes to a remote repository.
- From the right option (*Start a hosted project*), you can create a remote repository on one of the available platforms (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.), connect to it, and download the repository as well.

Let's assume you have already created a remote repository, so we will choose the first option (*Open a project*). Then, you must select the Git platform to connect with. In our case, we will choose GitHub, so click on the corresponding button.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-24-GitKraken_Clone.png" alt="GitKraken clone remote repository" width="80%"/>
</div>

You must select the repository to clone and the folder where you want to download the project, using the right panel. Then, click on the *Clone the repo!* button in the bottom-right corner.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-25-GitKraken_Clone2.png" alt="GitKraken clone remote repository" width="80%"/>
</div>

Once your repository is cloned, you can explore it from the *Open a project* option or by clicking on the folder icon in the upper-left corner of the GitKraken window.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-26-GitKraken_OpenProject.png" alt="GitKraken open project" width="80%"/>
</div>

After selecting the project folder (or the project itself if you have opened it recently), you will see its contents:

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-27-GitKraken_ProjectContents.png" alt="GitKraken open project" width="80%"/>
</div>

In the right panel, you can see the project contents (files and folders). You can view them as paths or as a tree by clicking the corresponding buttons on this right section. The middle panel shows the history of operations on the repository (commits, etc.). Finally, the left panel displays a list of available branches.

#### 1.1. Committing New Changes

If you add new content to the project (or edit/remove existing content), the changes will automatically be shown in the right panel. For instance, if you add a new source file, it will appear like this:

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-28-GitKraken_CommitChanges.png" alt="GitKraken commit changes" width="80%"/>
</div>

Next, click the *View Changes* button to see the file(s) that have changed. You can stage them individually (i.e., mark them to be committed in the next commit operation) or stage all at once by clicking the *Stage all changes* button.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-29-GitKraken_CommitChanges.png" alt="GitKraken commit changes" width="80%"/>
</div>

The next step is to commit the changes. Add a commit comment (explaining what's new in this commit) and click on *Commit changes* at the bottom.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-30-GitKraken_CommitChanges.png" alt="GitKraken commit changes" width="45%"/>
</div>

Finally, you need to push the changes to the remote repository. To do this, go to the middle panel, select the commit you want to push, and click on the *Push* button in the upper toolbar.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-31-GitKraken_CommitChanges.png" alt="GitKraken commit changes" width="80%"/>
</div>

#### 1.2. Pulling New Content from the Server

If you're working in a team or need to update your changes on another computer, you may need to pull content from the repository. For example, if someone has uploaded new files (or changed existing files) to the repository, click the *Pull* button in the upper toolbar. Then, select the corresponding commit in the list (middle panel) and view all the affected files in the right panel.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-32-GitKraken_PullChanges.png" alt="GitKraken pull changes" width="80%"/>
</div>

#### 1.3. Alternatives to GitKraken

There are other Git tools you can use instead of GitKraken to manage GitHub or BitBucket repositories using a graphical interface. Here are some of them:

- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

These tools are available for Windows and macOS, but cannot be used on Linux systems, which is why we've focused on GitKraken.

> **Exercise 1**:  
> Create a public repository called **CppPrograms** in your GitHub account. Clone it into a local folder using GitKraken. Then, copy the following program into a source file called *hello.cpp* inside that folder:
> 
> ```cpp
> #include <iostream>
> 
> using namespace std;
> 
> int main()
> {
>     cout << "Hello world";
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
>
> Once you have finished copying the file, follow these steps:
> - Commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
> - Make some changes to the previous source file, for example, change the text being printed in the `cout` line. Then, make a second commit and push to update the changes.
> - Optionally, you can share your project with a classmate and ask them to update some files. Then, update those files in your local repository using a pull operation.

### 2. Using Git in Visual Studio Code

Most modern IDEs let you use Git internally, so you can perform the main Git operations (commit, push, pull, etc.) from within the IDE itself. Let's see how this works with Visual Studio Code.

First, you need to clone your remote repository. Open the command palette (`Control+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac systems) and type "clone." Select the `git clone` command, and you will be asked to enter the remote URL of the repository. Paste the URL of your GitHub or Bitbucket repository (which you can find by clicking on the *Clone* button).

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-19-VSCodeGit.png" alt="Clone repository" width="50%"/>
</div>

> **NOTE**: If the `git clone` command is not recognized by VS Code, Git is not properly installed on your system (see previous sections of this course).

Once the repository is cloned, you'll see the files in Visual Studio Code. If you modify any file, it will automatically be marked with an 'M' next to the file name, indicating it has been modified from the last version uploaded to the repository. You can stage the file by clicking the *Source Control* icon. This shows the changes made

 and Git options.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-20-VSCodeGit2.png" alt="Commit" width="50%"/>
</div>

You can stage (+), undo changes, commit (✓), and find more general options in the upper menu.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-21-VSCodeGit3.png" alt="Commit" width="50%"/>
</div>

To push or pull changes, click on the *more options* button (`...`) in the upper left toolbar and select the appropriate option.

<div align="center">
	<img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-21-VSCodeGit4.png" alt="Pull/Push options" width="50%"/>
</div>

> **Exercise 2**:  
> Create a new public repository called **CppProgramsVSCode** in your GitHub account, and then clone it from VS Code. Repeat the steps from Exercise 1 in this new repository.

### 3. Using Git in IntelliJ

Git integration in *IntelliJ* is simple:

- To **clone or download a remote repository**, go to *VCS > Get from Version Control*. Log into your GitHub account and choose from your available repositories.
- To **create a new remote repository**, first create the *IntelliJ* project, then go to *VCS > Share project on GitHub*. You will be prompted to name the project and select whether it is public or private, as well as which files to include in the initial commit.
- To **commit changes**, choose *Git > Commit...*, select the changes, and add a commit message.
- To **push or pull changes**, use the options under the *Git* menu.

> **Exercise 3**:  
> Create a new local Java project called **IntelliJGit**. Share the project on your GitHub account, add a new class called `Test`, and commit and push the changes.

### 4. Using Git in Visual Studio

Visual Studio can also manage Git repositories. First, you might need to install the GitHub extension for Visual Studio from *Extensions > Manage Extensions*.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-42_VisualStudio_GitIntegration.png" alt="Visual Studio integration with Git" width="70%"/>
</div>

To communicate with a remote repository, go to *Team > Manage Connections*. The first time, you'll need to log in to GitHub and grant permissions to Visual Studio. Then, you can either create a local Git repository or clone a remote one.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-38_VisualStudio_GitIntegration.png" alt="Visual Studio integration with Git" width="40%"/>
</div>

If you choose to clone a repository, specify the remote URL and the local folder to download it. After adding projects and making changes, double-click the repository to see pending changes. Add a commit comment and confirm the commit.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-39_VisualStudio_GitIntegration.png" alt="Visual Studio integration with Git" width="40%"/>
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-40_VisualStudio_GitIntegration.png" alt="Visual Studio integration with Git" width="40%"/>
    &nbsp;
    <img src="../../img/ED_b1_tema05-41_VisualStudio_GitIntegration.png" alt="Visual Studio integration with Git" width="40%"/>
</div>

Finally, choose the *Synchronize* option to push the changes to the remote repository. You may be asked to enter your credentials. You can also use this option to pull updated content from the repository before making changes.

> **Exercise 4**:  
> Create a new remote repository called **VisualStudioTest** in your GitHub account. Clone it in Visual Studio, add a project, and upload the changes to the remote repository.
