When a software development company decides to initiate a project, it needs to consider several key factors, such as: where did the idea originate, and who will be responsible for managing the project?

### 1. Project Origin

The project idea can stem from:

* The company itself, as part of its internal developments, in which case the company acts as its own customer.
* An external entity or company that requests the software product. In this case, the company functions as a software provider.

In both scenarios, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the product to be developed and assess its viability. This process is usually more straightforward with external clients since the project can be tailored to meet both parties' needs and generate profit. However, for internal developments, where there is no immediate external revenue, it's critical to evaluate if the project is truly worth pursuing.

### 2. The Project Manager

The project manager is an experienced professional responsible for overseeing the entire development process. Key considerations include:

* The manager should be involved in the decision to initiate the project.
* The selected candidate should have proven expertise in the project's business domain, as well as strong interpersonal and team management skills.

The project manager’s responsibilities include:

* Identifying potential risks within the project.
* Setting budgets, timelines, and task assignments.
* Facilitating effective communication among team members.
* Defining how communication with the customer will be managed.

### 3. Gathering Requirements

The first phase of the software development process is requirements analysis, which can be divided into two parts: requirements specification and software analysis. This section focuses on how to gather the necessary requirements for the system being developed.

Communication with the customer is vital in this process, as it helps clarify what they truly want. However, two primary challenges often arise:

* Developers may not fully understand what the customer needs.
* Customers may not know what information is essential for developers to build the application.

To mitigate these challenges, it's essential to:

* Identify reliable sources of information within the customer’s organization.
* Ask the right questions and comprehend the customer’s needs.
* Verify the requirements with the customer to ensure understanding.
* Compile these requirements into a document known as the **System Requirements Specification** (SRS).

#### 3.1. Techniques for Gathering Information

Several techniques can be used to gather information from the customer, establish application requirements, and assess viability. Some of the most common (and often complementary) techniques include:

* **Interviews**: A widely used technique that requires proper preparation and experience from the analyst to be effective.
* **Joint Application Development (JAD)**: A process where customers and analysts collaborate to define the product's features. This method involves workshops or meetings (typically 2-4 days each) with participants from both the customer’s and software company’s teams.
* **Observation**: This involves analyzing how the customer’s company operates and determining how the software might fit into its processes.
* **Documentation Study**: A review of the official documents within the company that describe its internal workings.
* **Questionnaires**: Useful for gathering information from a large number of people in a short period, especially when participants are geographically dispersed.
* **Brainstorming**: This technique is helpful when requirements are unclear at the outset, allowing the team to collect initial ideas.

#### 3.2. More on Interviews

An interview is a systematic method of obtaining information through a structured conversation. It's not just about asking questions—the questions should be well-organized and follow a clear purpose. The structure of the interview determines the quality of the information gathered.

A successful interview includes these stages:

* **Preparation**: Research the customer’s organization, identify key interviewees, and prepare the interview content, including scheduling the date and time. It’s common to start with managers and move down to employees. Sometimes, a courtesy interview with a department head is necessary to facilitate interviews with subordinates.
* **Interview Execution**: This is the main part of the process and includes three sub-stages:
   * **Introduction**: Introduce yourself, explain the purpose of the interview, and outline how the interview will proceed. This helps the interviewee feel comfortable.
   * **Development**: Start with broader, open-ended questions, leading to more specific ones. Adapt your language to the listener (e.g., avoid technical jargon with non-technical staff), and verify the answers by repeating them back to the interviewee.
   * **Conclusion**: Summarize the interview, thank the interviewee for their time, and leave the door open for a follow-up interview if necessary.

> 
> * Interviews are generally the most effective method for gathering information for a software project.
> * JAD is a quick method for specifying requirements in projects involving multiple departments.
> * Questionnaires are useful when gathering information from customers who are geographically distant.
> * Observation and documentation alone can produce a highly accurate SRS.

### 4. System Requirements Specification (SRS)

Using the customer needs gathered through the techniques discussed, the next step is to define the application requirements—both hardware and software—in the **System Requirements Specification (SRS)** document. This document describes, in as much detail as possible, what the software product will do.

Before proceeding, let’s define what a requirement is: a **requirement** is a condition that must be met to solve a problem or achieve a goal. These requirements form the basis of the system's constraints.

For example, if a broker asks for an investment application, they may prioritize quick response times, which are essential for buying and selling stocks optimally. In this case, quick response time would be a critical requirement.

#### 4.1. Types of Requirements

There are three main types of requirements:

* **System Requirements**: These are the hardware and additional software components needed to install or run the application, such as the number of computers, processors, storage space, or database servers.
* **Functional Requirements**: These define what the system should do, including inputs, outputs, user interactions, and stored data. For example, the system might require user authentication or send periodic emails.
* **Non-Functional Requirements**: These specify how well the system should perform, covering aspects like **performance** and **security**. Non-functional requirements are less critical in terms of functionality but can impact the system’s performance. 
   * A specific subcategory of non-functional requirements is **usability**, which measures how easy it is for users to interact with the application. To ensure good usability, we must analyze the end-users' skill level, working environment, and evaluate the user interface, avoiding cluttered screens and considering special needs like left-handed users.

> **Proposed Exercises:**
> 
> **Exercise 2:**
> 
> Read the following scenario and identify the system, functional, and non-functional requirements:
> 
> *A blog has three types of users: administrators, editors, and visitors. All users must log in to access the application. Administrators can register other users, editors can publish posts, and visitors can comment on them. The website is expected to handle a large volume of daily traffic, so high availability is crucial. Several servers will be used to balance the load and distribute client access. Since the editors are inexperienced, the user interface must be simple. All posts and comments will be stored in a MySQL database with daily backups, and passwords will be encrypted to prevent security breaches.*

> **Exercise 3:**
> 
> For the following software proposal, identify the system, functional, and non-functional requirements:
> 
> *A cultural organization manages loans of two types of items: music discs and books. The application should allow users to add new items of both types. Users must log in with a username and password, and they can search for items by type (disc/book) or by title. Users can request items that are not currently available, with a limit of 5 items on loan simultaneously. Since the organization is located in a small town, user activity is expected to be low, so only one computer and a small database are needed. If a user forgets their password, the system will email it to the registered email address.*

> **Exercise 4:**
> 
> Classify the following requirements as system, functional, or non-functional:
> 
> * The application must save data before closing.
> * The database server must be hosted on a separate computer.
> * If the connection to the remote server is lost, the application should display an error message and close.
> * Response time must not exceed 10 milliseconds.
> * Sufficient bandwidth is required for real-time video streaming.
> * The system must verify the user's entered name, ID, and phone number.
