## Agile methodologies - Exercise solutions

> **Exercise 1:** 
> 
> In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlLHc60egiQ">this video</a> you have a summary of Scrum methodology. After watching it, try to answer these questions:

> *Solution*:

> 1. What is a *sprint* in Scrum?

A *sprint* is every iteration of the development process

> 2. Who is in charge of prioritizing the tasks to do in every *sprint*?

The development team

> 3. How can the final delivery date of a *sprint* be calculated?

We can calculate it by adding the estimated time for every user story included in this sprint. Besides, we can use a *burndown chart* to calculate the current estimation and see how far/near we are from our initial estimation.

> **Exercise 2:**
>  
> In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8dYLbJiTUE) you have an example of Kanban methodology. Try to answer to these questions after watching it:

> *Solution*:

> 1. What is the main function of WIP limits? What happens when we try to move a task to a column that exceeds this limit?

They should be set so that the work flows as smoothly and consistently as possible. If the team runs into a problem, WIP limits will show a bottleneck that requires the collaboration of (maybe) the whole team in order to solve it and keep the work flowing.

> 2. How can Kanban and Scrum be combined? Which is the main purpose of adding Scrum to Kanban?

Scrum provides the structure for organizing feedback, short-term planning and other organizational improvements, as Kanban focuses on day-to-day development.
